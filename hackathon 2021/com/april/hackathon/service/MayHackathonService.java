	// You are asked Q questions. For each question, you have to determine whether
	// the given number X can be represented as a sum of two or more consecutive
	// positive integers. For example, the answer for X=9 is Yes as 9=2+3+4 while
	// the answer for 2 is No (note that (âˆ’1)+0+1+2=2 is invalid as only positive
	// integers are allowed).

	// we know that if and only if number is power of 2 then this number never
	// consecutive number.
	// Otherwise it is consecutive

	// we can check number is power of 2 or not by this formula
	// (num & num - 1) then it will be power of two
	// else it is not power of 2
	
	// if (n & n - 1) == 0 then it is power of 2 else not;
